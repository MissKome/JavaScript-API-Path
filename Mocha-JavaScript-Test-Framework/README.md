~Mocha is a JavaScript-based testing framework running on NodeJS and browser.

~Mocha is used to oranize and excute test cases.

~Mocha makes asynchronous testing to be simple and fun to execute.

~Mocha has two pre-bundled function calls; describe( ) and it () functions.

ğŸ‘‰describe () : is a simple way to group our tests in mocha

ğŸ‘‰it (): is a way to describe the individual test cases. 


~Mocha Hooks
ğŸ‘‰before () : runs before all tests in the code block
ğŸ‘‰after () : runs after all tests in the code block
ğŸ‘‰beforeEach () : runs before each tests in the code block
ğŸ‘‰afterEach () : runs after each tests in the code block
