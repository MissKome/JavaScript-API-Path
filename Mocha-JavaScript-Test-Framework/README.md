~Mocha is a JavaScript-based testing framework running on NodeJS and browser.

~Mocha is used to oranize and excute test cases.

~Mocha makes asynchronous testing to be simple and fun to execute.

--Mocha has two pre-bundled function calls; describe( ) and it () functions.

-describe () : is a simple way to group our tests in mocha
-it (): is a way to describe the individual test cases.
